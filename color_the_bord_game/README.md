'color the board' is about to color the board in the target-color.

The white LEDs that flash in the beginning are just for the optics.  
They have no use except making a kind of loading-animation.  

The blinky LED with one color shows the target-color.  
The blinky LED with two colors is the color-change-spot.  
Button A changes the color at the color-change-spot from the one color,  
that is shown long to the color, that is shown short.  
After changing color it moves all the LEDs clockwise except the target-color.  
Button B only moves all LEDs clockwise except the target-colors.  
The Switch toggles sounds, played at the start of each round/game.  
The game starts again after coloring the board in the target-color.  

Programmed for adafruit circuit playground express.
