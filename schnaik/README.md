A shitty snake implementation using python3 and pygame.  
Make sure to have pygame installed (`pip install pygame`).  
To start type `python main.py`.  

To be implemented on the next game jam:
- Game over when snake hits itself
- Some kind of speed boost or special food
- Score label
- Start and stop screen
- Highscore
