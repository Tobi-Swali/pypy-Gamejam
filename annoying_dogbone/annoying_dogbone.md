# Annoying_Dogbone

**Epilepsy warning !!** This Sketch will cycle through the flashing Neopixel LEDs!

Made for 2 Players. There's no real goal to achieve, but each player is assigned one Button (a or b) and the respective Neopixel LEDs on the player's side of the PCB (1-5, 6-10). 
If a player pressed the button while one of the opponent's LEDs is lit it will sound a very annoying Dog Toy sound. GL HF!
